Five shimmering portals glow across its surface—paths of knowledge disguised as trials. 
The choice is yours, traveler… 

💜 Purple Portal — Malware
Hidden programs that corrupt, spy, and destroy. 
Learn how shadows slip into your system.

🔵 Blue Portal — Phishing
Impostors mimic voices of trust 
to lure you into surrendering secrets.

🔴 Red Portal — Identity Theft
When your name, your life, your very self 
is stolen and worn by another.

🟡 Yellow Portal — Quishing
QR-code trickery that hides traps 
behind innocent squares.

💚 Green Portal — Password Security
The keys to your digital kingdom. 
Strong or weak, they decide your fate.

Choose carefully. 
Each portal leads to trials of awareness—
and the power of protection.`;   // 👈 CLOSES HERE
